I made the local storage work again. Now, i 
need to implement the function that when i click
on a text that has been in the memory already 
it gets deleted.

When i click on the pencil, all the items
that were in the div get deleted. Good. Now
it's time to make the text inside the 
"all text" element

Make the text so that when u click, the text
get underlined.
